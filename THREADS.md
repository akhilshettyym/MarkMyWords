### ‚ùå Why Turbopack is NOT Used
Turbopack is an experimental bundler developed by Vercel (creators of Next.js), written in Rust. It aims to replace Webpack with faster startup and hot reload times. However, it is not yet production-ready, lacks full Webpack config support, and may introduce bugs during development.
- We chose not to use Turbopack because:
- Stability is preferred for full-stack apps
- Custom configuration flexibility is required
- Turbopack is still in its experimental phase

## Why use mongoose
üß© Why Mongoose?
Mongoose is a powerful ODM library for MongoDB.
‚úÖ Benefits of using Mongoose:

- Schema-based modeling: Define clear data structures for MongoDB collections.
- Validation: Ensure data integrity with built-in validators.
- Middleware support: Add hooks before/after actions like save, remove, etc.
- Query helpers: Simplify database interactions with chaining methods.
